    <p><h1>CATS</h1></p>
    <p> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. <br>
    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.<br>
    Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. </p>
